        <h2>An Idea</h2>
        The process of creating these chess pieces was labor-intensive but spiritually fulfilling. I poured resin into
        molds, each piece requiring patience and precision. As I worked, I thought of the symbolism the bishops would hold.
        The number 106 came from the exact number of weeks I would spend on my mission, and it gave me a sense of purpose
        and focus as I shaped the pieces. I envisioned how these bishops would be my companions, each one standing for a
        week of challenges, growth, and learning. These pieces weren’t just chess figures; they became representations of
        faith, resilience, and dedication.

        <br>
        <h3>Still Just An Idea</h3>
        Once I had completed all 106 bishops, I felt a sense of accomplishment and excitement for my mission ahead. I
        decided that each week, I would set out a bishop in a different place that reminded me of the experiences, feelings,
        or lessons I encountered during that week. Whether I was in a bustling city, a quiet village, or a remote area, I
        would carefully place one of the bishops in a spot that had significance to the events or emotions I was
        experiencing. It could be near a sunset, by a landmark, or on a quiet street corner—each spot would hold its own
        story.

        <br><br>
        <h4>Alright Now We're Getting Somewhere</h4>
        I took a picture of the bishop wherever I placed it, creating a visual journal of sorts. Each picture was a snapshot
        of the week, a way to preserve the memory, and a way to reflect on how far I had come. I was always intentional
        about the locations, finding places that held meaning and reminded me of the lessons I was learning in the mission
        field. These pictures weren’t just about capturing the environment; they were about capturing the growth I was
        undergoing spiritually and personally. The bishop chess pieces, once static in my hands, became dynamic markers of
        my mission's journey.

        <h5>Overelaborating On a Basic Idea</h5>
        As the weeks passed, I looked forward to setting out my bishop for the week. It became a ritual, a quiet moment of
        reflection amid the busyness of missionary work. Each time I placed a bishop, I would pause and think about the
        experiences that week had brought. I would reflect on the people I met, the challenges I faced, and the progress I
        had made in my own faith. It became a grounding moment in the midst of all the change and growth I was undergoing.
        The bishops, once crafted and placed, would silently watch over me as I navigated the next chapter of my life.

        <h6>Nearing The End Of The Mission</h6>
        At the end of my two-year mission, I had a collection of 106 photographs, each one telling the story of a week. I
        also had all the bishops, now worn and weathered by time, each one representing a specific part of my journey. The
        collection wasn’t just a physical reminder of where I had been; it was a spiritual journal that chronicled the highs
        and lows of my mission. Each bishop had a story, a place in the world, and a lesson that helped shape the person I
        had become.
        <br>
        <h6>Looking Back</h6>
        Looking back now, those 106 resin bishops are not just symbols of a game, but of a journey—a two-year pilgrimage
        that shaped my character and deepened my faith. Every time I look at them, I am reminded of the lessons learned, the
        people I met, and the memories I created. The bishops I placed around the world became more than just pieces of
        resin; they became silent witnesses to my transformation, each one carrying a week’s worth of experiences, growth,
        and a reminder of the importance of perspective in life, just like the bishop in the game of chess.
